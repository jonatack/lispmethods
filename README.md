# In Lisp

This is a blog about (ANSI) Common Lisp, and how to do useful things with it.
I do not intend to convince you that Lisp is a fundamentally better
programming language, or other opinionated nonsense. There is enough of that
spread across the internet already.

However I will not attempt to disguise the fact that **I rather enjoy hacking in
Lisp**.

Any references I make to "Lisp" really refer to Common Lisp, unless I explicitly
state otherwise. I'm just lazy like that. Also, I usually assume you are running
SBCL.

I will mention Python and Javascript quite often, simply because they are the
only other "high level" languages I have enough experience with to talk about
confidently.

I assume at least an intermediate level of programming experience (any language
will do) - if you don't know how to open a command prompt, this probably isn't
for you. Go and read:

Many things I write will probably be wrong. Please educate me.
