## Get In A Lispy Mood

There are many introductions to lisp

It is possible to develop lisp in the same way you would develop Python, for
example. This style of development typically goes like this:
1. Write some code to do something
2. Run the code
3. Put in some debug prints or breakpoints to figure out why it doesn't do as
   expected
4. Fix the code
5. GOTO 2 until it works

Problems:
- State
- Debug 'mode'

It is possible to do some of this in Python (e.g. using `reload` in the REPL),
but the experience is not as slick.
